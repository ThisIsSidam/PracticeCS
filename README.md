# PracticeCS
Contains practice programs I made while learning C#. The tic tac toe is the best of them all.

The programs are actually of when I was learning C++, there is a different repo for its notes, I just wrote those programs again in C#.
I did not do someone of them because of some reasons, but I did most of them. And in the end, I made a Tic Tac Toe programs to finish it 
off. Now the next won't be practice, they'll be projects. I don't know of what though.

I don't know if anyone will ever read this, but if you did, Thank You.
